# Optimize_Engagement
A project that integrates time and budget constraints to optimize post engagement by determining the optimal allocation between external marketing spend and time spent on post editing.<br>
Optimization is achieved using penalty methods, cyclic coordinate descent, and the golden ratio technique.<br>
The code can be executed through the test_28 file to run the optimization process.

**The file group_28 is the second part of the project**<br> 
We solve the same problem using a genetic algorithm to optimize the allocation between external marketing spend and post editing time.<br> 
This approach provides an alternative solution to the time and budget constraints for maximizing post engagement.**
